3D Collections have ``set_offset3d`` and ``get_offset3d`` methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All 3D Collections (``Patch3DCollection``, ``Path3DCollection``,
``Poly3DCollection``) now have ``set_offset3d`` and ``get_offset3d`` methods
which allow you to set and get the offset of the collection in data
coordinates. In other words, this allows you to set and get the position of the
of the collection points.
