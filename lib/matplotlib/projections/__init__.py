"""
Non-separable transforms that map from data space to screen space.

Projections are defined as `~.axes.Axes` subclasses.  They include the
following elements:

- A transformation from data coordinates into display coordinates.

- An inverse of that transformation.  This is used, for example, to convert
  mouse positions from screen space back into data space.

- Transformations for the gridlines, ticks and ticklabels.  Custom projections
  will often need to place these elements in special locations, and Matplotlib
  has a facility to help with doing so.

- Setting up default values (overriding `~.axes.Axes.cla`), since the defaults
  for a rectilinear Axes may not be appropriate.

- Defining the shape of the Axes, for example, an elliptical Axes, that will be
  used to draw the background of the plot and for clipping any data elements.

- Defining custom locators and formatters for the projection.  For example, in
  a geographic projection, it may be more convenient to display the grid in
  degrees, even if the data is in radians.

- Set up interactive panning and zooming.  This is left as an "advanced"
  feature left to the reader, but there is an example of this for polar plots
  in `matplotlib.projections.polar`.

- Any additional methods for additional convenience or features.

Once the projection Axes is defined, it can be used in one of two ways:

- By defining the class attribute ``name``, the projection Axes can be
  registered with `matplotlib.projections.register_projection` and subsequently
  simply invoked by name::

      fig.add_subplot(projection="my_proj_name")

- For more complex, parameterisable projections, a generic "projection" object
  may be defined which includes the method ``_as_mpl_axes``. ``_as_mpl_axes``
  should take no arguments and return the projection's Axes subclass and a
  dictionary of additional arguments to pass to the subclass' ``__init__``
  method.  Subsequently a parameterised projection can be initialised with::

      fig.add_subplot(projection=MyProjection(param1=param1_value))

  where MyProjection is an object which implements a ``_as_mpl_axes`` method.

A full-fledged and heavily annotated example is in
:doc:`/gallery/misc/custom_projection`.  The polar plot functionality in
`matplotlib.projections.polar` may also be of interest.

Import Error Handling: The error handling when importing Axes3D is broad and may not clearly indicate what went wrong. It also may lead to confusion if the import fails for reasons other than having multiple installations.

Missing Documentation: The class and method docstrings could be more detailed to provide better context for users.

Unregistered Projections: If a projection class is registered after importing, it won't be available until the registry is updated, which might not be intuitive for users.

Redundant Import: The way Axes3D is handled might lead to confusion if it’s not available, as it's deleted from the namespace. This may not be necessary if you want to keep the name in the context.

Suggested Corrections:
Here’s a revised version of your code that addresses these issues:

Key Improvements:
Specific Import Error Handling: Changed the exception to ImportError to make it clear what type of error occurred.
Clearer Docstrings: Updated the docstrings to provide more context.
Value Error on Duplicate Registration: Added a check to prevent registering the same projection name multiple times.
No Deletion of Axes3D: Instead of deleting Axes3D, it simply remains None if not imported, which may be more intuitive for users.
